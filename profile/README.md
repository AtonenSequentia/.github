# ATONEN SEQUENTIA
Open-Source Sicentific Mathematical And Computational Studies Project

Atonen Sequentia is a mathematical number sequence that has been around for a while,\
which had never been named anything, but now by [Victor Kolis](https://github.com/victorkolis) as The Atone Sequence (Sequ√™ncia √Åtona, PT [üáßüá∑]).

This sequence contains the numbers: `[1, 3, 7, 15, 31]`
The mathematical [Gogito Ergo Sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse_on_the_Method), or function is:
(n * 2) + 1

"I believe this sequence is the Pascal's triangle outlier that sits in both sides of it. The Atone Triangles" - Victor Kolis
<pre>
1   1   1   1   1   1   1
  1   1   1   1   1   1
    1   1   2   1   1
      1   3   3   1
</pre>

## The name origin
The numbers in the sequence themselves, cannot represent much at first in the decimal layer. However,
in the binary form each line the sequence represent the numbers that are generated by the `(n * 2) + 1` expresison.
"Since all the numbers have the binary `'1'` in common I decided to name it Atonen Sequentia, which means the sequence of ones" - Victor Kolis

A Python code representation of that sequence
```python
# Author: Victor Kolis
# Date: 2022-11-19
# Purpose: Generate the Atone Sequence

def atonen(amount=500):
    atonen_sequence = []
    for i in range(amount):
        try:
            atonen_sequence += [int((i+1) * '1', 2)]
        except OverflowError as e:
            raise e('This value cannot be processed')
    return atonen_sequence
```
